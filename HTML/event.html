          <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.

      This image shows a vintage illustration of a complex scientific apparatus, likely for a chemistry or medical experiment. The intricate setup consists of various glassware, such as flasks, tubes, beakers, and distillation columns, connected by thin pipes and supports. The equipment is arranged in a long horizontal sequence, showing processes like heating, distillation, condensation, and collection. Towards the right end, there is an anatomical depiction of a human brain in profile, suggesting that the experiment might be related to brain science or neurology"
