          <h1>Support</h1>
          <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
            very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
            accessible to the whole community.
          </p>
          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s
          collections.
          <p>
            If you have some item or collection that you think others would
            enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department
            and they will be able to assist you.

          <h1>Volunteer</h1>
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
            contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
            involved.

The background is blurred, giving a professional and modern vibe."

          <h1>Internships</h1>
          <p>
            Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and
            excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at
            the museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people
            who are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider
            community.
